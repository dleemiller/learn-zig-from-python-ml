# Exercise 1.2: Variables and Constants

## Objective

Practice declaring and using variables and constants in Zig.

## Requirements

1. Declare a constant `MAX_SCORE` with value 100
2. Declare a mutable variable `current_score` starting at 0
3. Increment `current_score` by 25 three times
4. Print the final score

## Expected Output

```
Score: 75 / 100
```

## Concepts Tested

- `const` vs `var`
- Type annotations
- Mutability
- Print formatting

## Verification

```bash
zig build test-ex-01-02
```
