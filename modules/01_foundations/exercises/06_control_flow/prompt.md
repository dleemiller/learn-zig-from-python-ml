# Exercise 1.6: Control Flow

## Objective

Practice Zig's control flow: if expressions, switch statements, and loops.

## Requirements

1. Write an if expression that returns a string based on a number
2. Use a switch statement with multiple cases
3. Use a for loop with index
4. Use a while loop with continue expression

## Expected Output

```
5 is positive
Grade for 85: B
Numbers 1-5: 1 2 3 4 5
Countdown: 5 4 3 2 1
Sum of evens 1-10: 30
```

## Concepts Tested

- If as expression
- Switch exhaustiveness
- For with index
- While with continue expression

## Verification

```bash
zig build test-ex-01-06
```
